# SudokuSolve

A sudoku solver. 
Uses simulated annealing. Tuned for solving strenght, not speed. 

Simulated annealing is not, by any measure, the most optimal solving algoritm for sudoku puzzles. 
I made it mostly to see how different temperature gradients affected solving efficiency, and to practice programming.

Uses simulated annealing to solve classic sudoku puzzles. Will quickly and consistently solve easy to medium puzzles.
Hard puzzles are not consistenly solved and take relatively long time.
